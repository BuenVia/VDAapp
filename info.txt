Changes to the new site

1 Home Page

· Change Phone Number to home phone number 01472 840120

· Social Media buttons need attention

· The word webinars, has a square next to it, does it serve a purpose?

2. Vehicle Damage Assessor

· Happy with the info on the 5 linked pages. However, for all of the pages, rather than allowing them to download a brochure, can we just have a link to an enquiry form where they can tick what info the would like to receive. I’m happy to do it through Formsite, but at some point, wish to migrate away from that to a fully hosted solution through the website.

· On the last link Specialised Equipment and Tools I’m going to open a NuMonday shop, so it will possibly link to the shop

3. BS10125

· Change the page title to just BS1025. The standard is currently under consultation and will change very soon to a revised standard, but still prefaced with BS10125

· Again, on the linked pages, we’ll have link to an enquiry form, rather than a brochure download.

Due to the serious need to make some changes to the business, driven by the amount of time I am spending in the car driving from A to B, I am looking to increase dramatically, the VDA Services as these in terms of profitability and profit are far more valuable in relation to the other services. If at all humanly possible, do you think we can be sorted by the end of the month? If not, can you put a date on when you can have it ready to launch?
